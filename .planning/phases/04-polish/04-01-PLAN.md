  <files>
    coffee-landing/app/layout.tsx
    coffee-landing/app/opengraph-image.jpg
  </files>
  <action>
Update layout.tsx metadata export with complete SEO and Open Graph configuration:

1. Update the existing metadata object to include:
   - title: "Craft Coffee | Modern Specialty Coffee Experience"
   - description: "Where every cup is a journey. Discover our modern, design-forward approach to specialty coffee."
   - metadataBase: new URL('https://craftcoffee.example.com') (placeholder domain)
   - openGraph object with title, description, siteName: 'Craft Coffee', locale: 'en_US', type: 'website'
   - openGraph.images array pointing to '/opengraph-image.jpg' (1200x630)
   - twitter card configuration with 'summary_large_image'

2. Create a simple OG image file:
   - Generate an SVG-based placeholder image at coffee-landing/app/opengraph-image.jpg
   - Use brand colors (cream background: #F5F0E8, espresso text: #3D2E2A)
   - Include text "Craft Coffee, Elevated" centered
   - Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels
   - Note: For production, this should be replaced with a proper designed image

Use the exact Metadata API pattern from research - import Metadata type, export const metadata.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` in coffee-landing directory - should complete without errors.
View page source to confirm meta tags are present.
  </verify>
  <done>
layout.tsx exports complete metadata with title, description, and openGraph configuration.
opengraph-image.jpg exists in app directory.

  <name>Task 2: Create Footer component and integrate into page</name>
  <files>
    coffee-landing/app/components/Footer.tsx
    coffee-landing/app/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
1. Create Footer.tsx component:
   - Simple functional component with default export
   - Use semantic footer element
   - Apply consistent spacing: py-8 md:py-12 (proportional to About section's py-16 md:py-24)
   - Background: bg-brand-cream (matches site)
   - Subtle top border: border-t border-brand-espresso/10
   - Centered copyright text: "© {current year} Craft Coffee. All rights reserved."
   - Text styling: text-sm text-brand-espresso/60
   - Max-width container: max-w-6xl mx-auto (matches About section)

2. Update page.tsx:
   - Import Footer from "./components/Footer"
   - Add Footer component after the About component, inside main
   - Keep main wrapper with min-h-screen

Use dynamic year with {new Date().getFullYear()} - never hardcode the year.
Match horizontal padding pattern from About: px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-16.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000.
Scroll to bottom - footer should be visible with copyright text.
Check mobile and desktop widths in dev tools.
  </verify>
  <done>
Footer.tsx exists with copyright and consistent styling.
page.tsx imports and renders Footer after About section.
Footer visible at all screen sizes with centered copyright.

    Complete polish pass: SEO metadata with Open Graph configuration, and a minimal footer with copyright.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `npm run dev` in coffee-landing directory if not already running
    2. Visit http://localhost:3000
    3. Check browser tab - should show "Craft Coffee | Modern Specialty Coffee Experience"
    4. Right-click > View Page Source - search for "og:" meta tags, confirm present
    5. Scroll from hero through about to footer
    6. Verify: no jarring transitions, consistent cream background, footer feels connected
    7. Resize browser to mobile width (~375px) - footer should still be visible and readable
    8. Resize to tablet (~768px) and desktop (~1200px) - verify spacing feels consistent

    Optional social preview test:
    - Use https://www.opengraph.xyz/ or similar tool with localhost tunnel
    - Or deploy to Vercel preview and test share preview

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if visual cohesion is good, or describe any spacing/visual issues to fix</resume-signal>
