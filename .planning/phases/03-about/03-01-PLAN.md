<objective>

Output: About.tsx component with two-column grid (stacks on mobile), integrated into page.tsx

  <name>Task 1: Create About component with responsive layout</name>
  <files>
    coffee-landing/app/components/About.tsx

  </files>
  <action>
Create the About section component following research patterns:

1. Create `coffee-landing/app/components/About.tsx`:
   - Use CSS Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 md:gap-12 items-center`
   - Text column with:
     - `<h2>` using `font-display text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl mb-6`
     - `<p>` with `max-w-prose leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg`
     - Brand story copy about coffee craft, ritual, and connection
   - Image column with:
     - Container: `relative aspect-[4/3] md:aspect-square rounded-lg overflow-hidden`
     - `next/image` with `fill`, `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"`, `object-cover`
   - Section wrapper: `py-16 md:py-24 px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-16` with `max-w-6xl mx-auto` inner container
   - Add `id="about"` to section for potential anchor linking

2. Download a coffee-related placeholder image to `coffee-landing/public/about-coffee.jpg`:
   - Use curl to fetch from Unsplash source (coffee shop interior or beans)
   - Approximate dimensions: 800x600 or similar (will be responsive)
   - Example: `curl -L "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495474472287-4d71bcdd2085?w=800&q=80" -o coffee-landing/public/about-coffee.jpg`

Key patterns from research:
- Parent of `fill` image MUST have `relative` class
- Use `sizes` prop to prevent oversized downloads
- `max-w-prose` constrains line length for readability (65ch)
- `leading-relaxed` for comfortable line spacing (1.625)

    - File exists: `ls coffee-landing/app/components/About.tsx`
    - Image exists: `ls coffee-landing/public/about-coffee.jpg`
    - Component exports default function: `grep "export default" coffee-landing/app/components/About.tsx`
    - Uses next/image: `grep "import Image" coffee-landing/app/components/About.tsx`
    - Has responsive grid: `grep "grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2" coffee-landing/app/components/About.tsx`
  </verify>
  <done>About.tsx exists with two-column responsive grid, next/image with fill, and placeholder image downloaded</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Integrate About component into page</name>
  <files>coffee-landing/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update page.tsx to use the About component:

1. Add import at top: `import About from "./components/About"`
2. Replace the about placeholder section (lines 11-19) with `<About />`
3. Keep the hero section as-is (Phase 2 placeholder)

The result should be:
```tsx
import About from "./components/About"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen">
      {/* Hero placeholder - will be replaced in Phase 2 */}
      <section className="h-screen flex items-center justify-center px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-16">
        <h1 className="font-display text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl text-center">
          Coffee Shop
        </h1>
      </section>

      <About />
    </main>
  )
}
```
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Import exists: `grep "import About" coffee-landing/app/page.tsx`
    - Component rendered: `grep "<About" coffee-landing/app/page.tsx`
    - No placeholder text: `grep -v "Placeholder for the about" coffee-landing/app/page.tsx | wc -l` (should match file length)
    - Dev server compiles: `cd coffee-landing && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -5` (should show success)
  </verify>
  <done>page.tsx imports and renders About component, placeholder section removed, build succeeds</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. Run build: `cd coffee-landing && npm run build` - should complete without errors
2. Visual check at localhost:3000:
   - Scroll past hero to see About section
   - On desktop (md+): text left, image right (or vice versa)
   - On mobile: text and image stack vertically
   - Text is readable with comfortable line length
   - Image displays without distortion
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ABOUT-01: Heading "Our Story" and brand story paragraph visible
- ABOUT-02: Image alongside text on desktop, stacked on mobile
- ABOUT-03: Layout readable at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+)
- Build passes with no errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-about/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
