### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: SITE-01 (mobile-first responsive) placed in Phase 1 as the layout baseline. SITE-02/SITE-03 placed in Phase 4 as finishing touches that benefit from both sections being complete.
