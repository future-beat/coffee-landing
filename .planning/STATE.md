## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Hero and About are independent sibling phases (both depend on Phase 1 only, not on each other). Research confirmed no shared state between them.
- Roadmap: SITE-01 (mobile-first responsive) placed in Phase 1 as the layout baseline. SITE-02/SITE-03 placed in Phase 4 as finishing touches that benefit from both sections being complete.
- 01-01: Used Tailwind v4 @theme syntax for design tokens (cleaner than v3 extend approach)
- 01-01: Brand colors defined in oklch color space for perceptual uniformity and better accessibility
