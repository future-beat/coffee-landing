# Coffee Shop Landing Page

## What This Is

A sleek, modern landing page for a coffee shop focused on establishing brand presence and specialty coffee vibes. Two sections — a bold hero with tagline and an about/story section — designed to communicate quality and aesthetic rather than practical visit information.

## Core Value

Convey the coffee shop's modern, design-forward identity through minimal, impactful visuals.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Hero section with striking visual and punchy tagline
- [ ] About/story section sharing the shop's mission or backstory
- [ ] Modern, minimal aesthetic throughout
- [ ] Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Built with Next.js/React

### Out of Scope

- Menu or food/drink listings — not requested, keep it minimal
- Location, hours, or map — explicitly skipped; this is a vibe page
- Online ordering or e-commerce — not in scope
- Contact form — not needed for brand presence page

## Context

This is a brand presence landing page, not a utility page. The goal is to make visitors feel the specialty coffee aesthetic — clean lines, quality imagery, minimal copy. Think more "mood board" than "business listing."

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js/React — user preference

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Skip location/hours | User wants vibe over practicality | — Pending |
| Next.js over plain HTML | User preference for modern framework | — Pending |
